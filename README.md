The fMRI Movie Rest Prediction repository is dedicated to developing a robust and accurate model for predicting rest periods between movies using fMRI data. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning and neuroimaging techniques to uncover the underlying patterns in brain activity during movie-watching sessions.
